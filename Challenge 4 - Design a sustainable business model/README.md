# Challenge 4: Design a sustainable business model

## Table of Contents

- [Section I - Business Model](#section-i---business-model)
- [Section II - Agile Financial Plan](#section-ii---agile-financial-plan)
- [Section III - Funding the Project](#section-iii---funding-the-project)

## Section I - Business Model

Picking up on the business ideas from Challenge 3, we settled on the following idea:

```text
Reduce the amount of time users spend on screens by using machine learning
algorithms to recommend ways to stay off their phones
```

My business will be called ***ScreenSnooze***, a convenient play on words that
combines *screen* and *snooze*, as a way to identify the spirit of the app,
which is encouraging that people 'snooze' their devices.

Here is my Business Model Canvas based on Alexander Osterwalder's model:

## Section II - Agile Financial Plan

Using the given template, we have the following results:

![Investment](./img/investment.png)

![Revenues](./img/revenues.png)

![Variable Costs](./img/variable.png)

![Fixed Costs](./img/fixed.png)

![Own Resources and Bank Loan](./img/resources.png)

![Sales & Fees of the first year](./img/year1.png)

![Sales & Fees of the second year](./img/year2.png)

With all this data, we get the following curve:

## Section III - Funding the Project

Regarding funding options, Venture capital is worth consideing.

In exchange for shares in the business, venture capital firms invest in start-ups with significant growth potential. Several advantages of this kind of finance for the project include:

- **Risk mitigation**: Before making an investment, venture capital firms often undergo a thorough due diligence process, which can help lower the risks involved with early-stage startups.
- **Contributing to growth**: In addition to cash, venture capital firms can offer contacts and strategic advice to support the project's expansion and success.
- **Increasing expansion speed**: With access to large capital, the initiative may expand more quickly, potentially reaching more users and bringing in more money.
